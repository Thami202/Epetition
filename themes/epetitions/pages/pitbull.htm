    <h1>
   All pitbull taken away from their owners 
  </h1>

  <div><p>There have been several reported instances of death caused by pit bulls in South Africa. Pit bulls have been involved in fatal attacks on both humans and other animals.</p></div>
    <details>
      <summary><span class="summary">More details</span></summary>
      <div><p>These incidents have led to calls for stricter regulations on pit bulls and other dangerous breeds, with some municipalities implementing breed-specific legislation (BSL) that targets pit bulls and other "dangerous" breeds. Last year we lost many lives of people being killed by the pitbull , which means such dogs can not live with the society because people lives will always be in danger and people will always live in fear , which means all the owner of the dog has to give them up and no one should be allowed to own a pitbull</p></div>

  <h1 id="debate-threshold-heading">Parliament decided to  debate this petition</h1>
  <p>The issue of pitbull being a danger to the community was one that the goverment could not turn a blind eye on , so many factors were being discussed to try to find some of the solution of these petition such as , any breed of dog has the potential to cause harm or death if it is not properly trained or socialized, or if it is trained to be aggressive. Factors such as lack of proper training, socialization, and abuse or neglect can contribute to aggressive behavior in any breed of dog,responsible ownership and enforcing existing animal control laws.</p>
