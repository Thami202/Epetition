    <h1>
    Bring back the Death Penalty for child sexual abuse, rape and murder
  </h1>

  <div><p>The Government needs to bring back the death penalty by lethal injection for those convicted of rape, child sexual abuse, or murder. It has been far too long that children have been tortured and become victims of sexual abuse, with overly lenient punishment.</p></div>
    <details>
      <summary><span class="summary">More details</span></summary>
      <div><p>Parents who viciously beat their children to death deserve the death penalty, as do rapists. They are ruining not just victimsâ€™ lives but those of their families and loved ones too. Those who sexually abuse children should also receive the death penalty. We need to do more to protect our children from those who mean to do them harm. We need to protect our citizens and show them that the justice system is not broken. By bringing the death penalty back we will surely make people think twice before breaking the law.</p></div>
