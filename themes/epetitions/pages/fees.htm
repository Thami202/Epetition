<h1 id="response-threshold-heading">Government responded</h1>
<p class="secondary">This response was given on 03 January 2023</p>
<p>As the Government we are concerns about the cost of providing free education, concerns about the quality of education that would be provided if it were free, and concerns about the impact that free education would have on the economy. Additionally, we believe that individuals should be responsible for paying for their own education, as it can be seen as a personal investment in one's own future.<p>
