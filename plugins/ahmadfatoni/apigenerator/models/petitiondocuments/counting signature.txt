In October CMS, you can use the built-in function $this->signatureCount to count the number of signatures on a form or petition. You can call this function in your controller or component, and pass in the ID of the form or petition as an argument.

For example, in a controller:



public function onCountSignatures()
{
    $formId = post('formId');
    $signatureCount = $this->signatureCount($formId);
    return [
        'signatureCount' => $signatureCount
    ];
}


In a component, you can use this function in the php section:

function onRender()
{
    $this->signatureCount = $this->signatureCount($formId);
}

And in the template you can use the variable :

{{ signatureCount }}
